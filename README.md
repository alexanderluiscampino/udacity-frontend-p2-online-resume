# Udacity Project 2: Online Resume
Part of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree from Udacity.
The project utilizes concepts learned from [JavaScript Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud804-nd) and [Intro to JQuery](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud245-nd) courses.

##Purpose
Demonstrated mastery of the language's syntax through a series of challenges. Each multipart problem mimics a real-life challenge that front-end developers face. Was required to write clean code and apply knowledge of variables, objects, JSON, functions and control flow to successfully solve the challenges.
